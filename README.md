# Plover Canon
This is a Plover plugin that plays Pachelbel's Canon using [`musicpy`](https://github.com/Rainbow-Dreamer/musicpy). 

The canon will start playing when Plover receives a stroke, and will speed up and slow down depending on stroke speed.

## Installation

You have to install manually from the command line.

See the instructions [here](https://plover.wiki/index.php/Plugins).

For Windows: 

```
.\plover_console.exe -s plover_plugins install git+https://github.com/greenwyrt/plover_canon.git
```
